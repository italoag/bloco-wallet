# Documentation Updates Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created New Documentation Files:**
   - `internal/wallet/testdata/LOCALIZATION.md`: Comprehensive documentation of the keystore validation localization system
   - `internal/wallet/testdata/LOCALIZATION_CHANGES.md`: Summary of recent changes to the localization system

2. **Updated Design Document:**
   - Enhanced the "Error Messages Localization" section in `.kiro/specs/keystore-v3-import-fix/design.md`
   - Added details about multi-language support, dynamic message loading, and separation of validation feedback from recovery suggestions

3. **Added Test Coverage:**
   - Created `pkg/localization/keystore_messages_additions_test.go` with tests for:
     - Language-specific message loading
     - Message consistency across languages
     - Proper language switching behavior

4. **Database Support Changes:**
   - Updated documentation to reflect that SQLite is now the only supported database
   - Removed references to MySQL and PostgreSQL support in technical documentation

5. **Enhanced Language Configuration Handling:**
   - Improved language selection persistence in configuration files
   - Added robust handling for missing language settings in config files
   - Implemented automatic creation of [app] section when missing in config files

6. **Implemented Configuration File Management System:**
   - Created `pkg/config/file_manager.go` with robust file operations for configuration files
   - Added atomic write operations with backup and restore capabilities
   - Implemented validation for configuration files
   - Added directory creation functionality for configuration paths

## Key Improvements Documented

1. **Multi-language Support:**
   - Added documentation for English, Portuguese, and Spanish language support
   - Explained the language selection mechanism and how to add new languages

2. **Message Categories:**
   - Documented the different categories of messages (validation feedback and recovery suggestions)
   - Provided examples of each message type and their purpose

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Explained how messages are loaded based on the current language setting
   - Documented the conditional logic for language-specific message loading
   - Provided code examples for using the localization system

4. **Testing Guidelines:**
   - Added instructions for testing the localization system with different languages
   - Created comprehensive test cases to ensure message consistency

5. **Configuration File Management:**
   - Implemented atomic file operations to prevent configuration corruption
   - Added automatic backup system before any configuration changes
   - Created validation system to ensure configuration integrity
   - Improved error handling with detailed error messages

## Next Steps

1. **Consider Code Improvements:**
   - The code could be improved by using a switch statement instead of if-else conditions for language selection
   - The maps.Copy function could be used instead of manual key-value copying in loops

2. **Potential Documentation Enhancements:**
   - Add a section to the main README.md about language support if this becomes a user-facing feature
   - Create a developer guide for adding new languages to the system
   - Update any remaining documentation that might reference multiple database support
   - Add documentation about the configuration file format and structure

3. **Testing Recommendations:**
   - Ensure integration tests cover the localization system in the context of the UI
   - Add tests for edge cases like unsupported languages or missing translations
   - Verify that all tests are compatible with SQLite-only implementation
   - Create tests for the configuration file management system

4. **Database Simplification:**
   - Remove any remaining database-specific code for MySQL and PostgreSQL
   - Update configuration examples to reflect SQLite-only support
   - Consider simplifying database configuration options in the config files

5. **Configuration Management Improvements:**
   - Implement TOML section manager for better handling of configuration sections
   - Add network configuration formatting improvements
   - Create comprehensive validation for network configuration entries
