# Localization System Enhancement - Change Summary

## Overview of Changes

The recent changes to `pkg/localization/keystore_messages_additions.go` enhance the localization system for keystore validation error messages by adding support for multiple languages. This improvement is part of the keystore v3 import fix implementation.

## Key Changes

1. **Multi-language Support**: Added support for Portuguese and Spanish languages in addition to the default English.

2. **Dynamic Language Selection**: The system now dynamically loads messages based on the current language setting retrieved from `GetCurrentLanguage()`.

3. **Conditional Message Loading**: Added conditional logic to load language-specific messages:
   ```go
   currentLang := GetCurrentLanguage()
   if currentLang == "pt" {
       // Load Portuguese messages
   } else if currentLang == "es" {
       // Load Spanish messages
   }
   ```

4. **Comprehensive Message Sets**: Each language now has a complete set of messages covering:
   - Keystore file validation feedback
   - Recovery suggestions for various error scenarios

## Impact on User Experience

These changes improve the user experience in the following ways:

1. **Localized Error Messages**: Users now receive error messages in their preferred language, making it easier to understand and resolve issues.

2. **Actionable Feedback**: The system provides specific, actionable feedback during the keystore import process.

3. **Guided Recovery**: When errors occur, users receive language-specific suggestions on how to resolve the issues.

## Implementation Notes

- The localization system uses a global `Labels` map to store all messages.
- Language-specific messages are added to this map based on the current language setting.
- The default language is English, with Portuguese and Spanish as additional options.
- The system is designed to be easily extended with additional languages in the future.

## Testing Considerations

When testing the keystore import functionality, it's important to verify that:

1. Error messages are correctly displayed in the selected language
2. All error scenarios have appropriate localized messages
3. Language switching correctly updates the displayed messages

## Documentation

A new documentation file `internal/wallet/testdata/LOCALIZATION.md` has been created to provide detailed information about the localization system, including:

- Supported languages
- Message categories
- Implementation details
- Usage examples
- Testing guidelines
- Instructions for adding new languages
