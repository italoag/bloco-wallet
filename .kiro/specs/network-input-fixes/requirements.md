# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the network addition functionality in BLOCO Wallet Manager, specifically focusing on input handling problems detected on ARM64 MacBook systems, error handling during network selection, and proper logging configuration to prevent log messages from appearing in the terminal interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user on an ARM64 MacBook, I want to be able to type in the network search input field, so that I can search for and add new networks to my wallet configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the add network interface on an ARM64 MacBook THEN the system SHALL allow keyboard input in the search field
2. WHEN a user types characters in the network search field THEN the system SHALL display the typed characters in real-time
3. WHEN a user uses the network search functionality THEN the system SHALL work consistently across different processor architectures (ARM64 and Intel)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user searching for networks, I want to receive clear and meaningful error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network search fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message instead of `<no value>: searching network...`
2. WHEN a user presses Enter or Tab to select a network THEN the system SHALL either successfully add the network or provide a clear error message explaining the failure
3. WHEN an error occurs during network operations THEN the system SHALL log the detailed error information while showing a user-friendly message in the interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the terminal application, I want a clean interface without log messages cluttering the display, so that I can focus on the wallet management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN log messages SHALL be written to log files and NOT displayed in the terminal
2. WHEN the application runs THEN informational messages like "Crypto service initialized" SHALL only appear in log files
3. WHEN the application exits THEN logger sync errors SHALL be handled gracefully without displaying error messages to the user
4. WHEN font loading occurs THEN font-related messages SHALL be logged to files instead of the terminal

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the application, I want proper logging configuration, so that I can access detailed logs when needed while keeping the user interface clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes logging THEN it SHALL configure appropriate log file destinations
2. WHEN log files are created THEN they SHALL be stored in an appropriate directory with proper permissions
3. WHEN the logger encounters sync errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without affecting the user experience
4. IF log file writing fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different MacBook models, I want consistent network addition functionality, so that the application works reliably regardless of my hardware configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application on Intel MacBooks THEN network addition SHALL work without the current error messages
2. WHEN using the application on ARM64 MacBooks THEN network addition SHALL work with the same functionality as Intel systems
3. WHEN switching between different hardware platforms THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN network search and selection operations are performed THEN they SHALL complete successfully on both processor architectures
